# On-Chain Action Guard

A minimal on-chain guard contract that enforces
policy constraints before execution.

This pattern is commonly used in multisigs,
DAOs, and protocol risk management systems.

## Architecture

Caller
  ↓
ActionGuard (policy validation)
  ↓
Protected Contract (execution)

## Guarantees

- Explicit policy enforcement
- Cooldown & rate limiting
- Role-based authorization
- Composable with other contracts

## Non-Goals

- Execution logic
- Asset custody
- Governance UI

## Running Tests

```bash
forge test
